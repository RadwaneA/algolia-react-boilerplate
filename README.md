Index.jsx

- entry point to the application
- renders App.js into #root element in DOM
- #root is defined in index.html

App.jsx

- called by Index.jsx
- wraps child components with key functionality including:
  - [React router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview)
  - [Algolia instantsearch](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch)
  - [Recoil state management](https://recoiljs.org/)
- calls Main.jsx

Main.jsx

- contains static elements like header and footer (found in `./components`)
- contains routes for each page (found in `./pages`)
- wraps pages in AnimatePresence from [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/animate-presence/), which helps animate loading of pages
- it loads a single route (page), depending on the current URL

Homepage.jsx

- if federated search is true in configuration, loads federated search
- loads a banners component from `./components`
- maps over carousels from configuration and renders each carousel
- wraps all components in animations from framer-motion

SearchResultsPage.jsx

- called by Main.jsx for route `/search`
- loads components related to results

ProductDetails.jsx

- Display attributes of an individual product
  - Image

<h2 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">⭐️ Config</h2>

There are two places where application configuration is defined:

- utils/env.js contains the env variables like the algolia app ID, index names etc.

- config/config.js contains layout variables like the refinements, sorts etc.
  - the config is exported via an object which is controlled by a state atom (see state section for more details)

<h2 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">⭐️ Instantsearch State</h2>

By default, instantsearch manages its own state, as long as everything is wrapped in the <Instantsearch> component. Therefore generally we do not have direct access to state, it is all managed by IS (instantsearch) even with connected, customised widgets, but we do get access to many props provided by each widget.

However, there can be times when we want to access the inside of the instantsearch directly to manipulate it or do something that IS widgets cannot.

In order to do that, we use [StateResults](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/widgets/state-results/react/#connector) which can give us access to the internal state. It lives in its own component.

Every time the search results change, we store them in our own internal state as well as letting instantsearch store them in it's state. Our own state for search results lives in `/config/results`.

This means that you should first only use the Instantsearch state if you can and not access our own, but if needed, you can access our own using recoil (see state manager section).

How Configure it 👇

- You can edit or create one, and personalise the differrent fields:
  - Images (For the background, or for the thumbnails)
  - Link or Text for the buttons

[Magazine Layout](https://github.com/algolia/magazine-layout)

Thanks to the work from the 'Front End Team', we customized their injected content about 2 rules, one for free returns always display, and the 2nd for 'Nike Products'.
All these rules are modifiable in [Dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/apps/853MYZ81KY/rules/flagship_fashion).
You can modify, too an other index called 'flagship_fashion_influencers', it contains 2 influencers searchable, like the main index.

The Utility of this package is to wait before action, for example on the SearchBox, onChange wait some time before send query.
